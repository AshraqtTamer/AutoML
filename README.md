# üß† AutoML Project ‚Äî FLAML, LazyPredict & MLflow

This project demonstrates **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** using three main tools:
- **[FLAML](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML)** ‚Äî Fast Lightweight AutoML for efficient model tuning  
- **[LazyPredict](https://github.com/shankarpandala/lazypredict)** ‚Äî Quick model benchmarking for regression and classification  
- **[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)** ‚Äî Tracking and managing machine learning experiments  

---

## üìò Overview

The notebook automates the process of:
1. Loading and preparing datasets  
2. Automatically selecting and tuning models with **FLAML**  
3. Comparing multiple ML algorithms quickly using **LazyPredict**  
4. Logging metrics, parameters, and models with **MLflow**

This is ideal for anyone looking to streamline ML experimentation and evaluation.
